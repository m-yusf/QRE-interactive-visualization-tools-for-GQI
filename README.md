Overview:
The Quantum Resource Estimation Visualization Tool dynamically illustrates the computational resources required for various quantum 
algorithms across different qubit technologies. It utilizes an in- teractive web-based chart that plots the number of physical qubits 
against runtime, facilitating a clear understanding of the quantum computational landscape.

Chart Description:
The visualization chart plots runtime on the horizontal axis (logarithmic scale) and the number of physical qubits on the vertical axis 
(logarithmic scale). Each point on the chart represents a specific quantum computing task, colored and shaped according to the algorithm
and qubit technology used. The chart is capable of displaying data for multiple algorithms simultaneously, overlaying their resource 
demands for direct comparison.

Interactivity Features:
• Hover-over Feature: Detailed information about each data point, such as the exact number of qubits and runtime, appears in a tooltip 
when the user hovers over the point. This feature enhances the interactive experience by providing immediate data insights without 
cluttering the visual representation.

• Filter Controls: Two slider controls allow users to filter visible data based on qubit count and runtime, making it easier to focus 
on specific areas of interest within the vast dataset.

Legends and Customization:
• Qubit Modality: The chart includes legends for different qubit technologies, such as trapped ion, superconducting, and Majorana. 
Each modality is represented by unique colors and shapes, helping users distinguish between the data associated with different quantum 
technologies.

• Vendor Modality: This information is included within the Qubit Modality legend. By clicking on a qubit modality, the chart would show 
the corresponding vendor modality for that specific qubit modality.

• Algorithm Legend: Each quantum algorithm, such as Quantum Dynamics, Factoring, or Grover’s Algorithm, is indicated by a specific color 
and symbol. This legend aids in identifying which algo- rithm each data point corresponds to.

• Configuration Legend: The Configuration Legend is strategically placed at the top of the visual- ization chart, just under the title, 
to facilitate easy access and visibility. It displays different qubit configurations, each represented by a distinct color and geometric 
shape. Users can interact with the legend by clicking on a specific configuration. Upon doing so, the chart will dynamically update to 
show only the data points that correspond to the selected configuration, enabling a focused anal- ysis on how different qubit setups 
affect the resource requirements of quantum algorithms. This feature is instrumental in isolating the impact of specific qubit 
technologies and configurations on the computational demands of various quantum tasks.

• Dynamic Scaling: The axes of the chart automatically adjust based on the data filtered through user interaction, ensuring optimal 
visualization of the available data points at any given time.

Technical Implementation:
The chart is implemented using D3.js, a powerful JavaScript library for producing dynamic, interactive data visualizations in web browsers. 
The SVG elements generated by D3.js allow for high customization and interactive capability, crucial for the detailed data representation 
required in quantum resource estimation.

Conclusion:
This visualization tool serves as an interface for researchers and engineers in the field of quantum comput- ing, providing an intuitive 
and interactive way to explore the resource requirements of various quantum algorithms across different qubit technologies.
